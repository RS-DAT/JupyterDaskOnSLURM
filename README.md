# Jupyter and Dask on SLURM

This repository contains instructions and material to setup and run a Jupyter server and a Dask cluster on a SLURM system, such as the [Spider data processing platform](https://spiderdocs.readthedocs.io) and the [Snellius supercomputer](https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Snellius), both hosted by [SURF](https://www.surf.nl).

Have a look at the [User Guide](./user-guide.md) for detailed instructions on how to get started.
